DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2




                   HTTP1.1
	                 HTTP2
	

1. HTTP1.1 loads resources one after             1. HTTP2 is able to use single TCP 
    the other , so if one resource cannot                connection to send a multiply 
    be loaded it blocks all other resources             streams of data at once so that no 
    behind it.                                                           resource blocked any other 
                                                                              resources.

2.HTTP1.1 is very slower and it loads              2. HTTP2  is much faster and more 
  Single request for every TCP                              reliable than HTTP1.1.it avoids 
   connection.                                                         By using multiplexing.

3.It works on the textual format                        3. It works on Binary protocol.

4.It uses formats like gzip to compress            4. It uses HPACK compression to 
   the data transferred in the messages.               decrease the average size of
                                                                              header.

5.The flow control mechanism in HTTP1         5. It multiplexes the data streams utilizing 
    relies on the basic TCP connection.                 The same (one) tcp connection. So In
    In beginning itself, both the machines               this case both machines can 
    set their buffer sizes automatically.                    implement their flow control.

6.Both http1.1 and HTTP2 can use the            6. HTTP2 has made it a requirement to 
   same security mechanisms such as                   use a encryption, which promotes
   SSL/TLS etc.,                                                      improves security for data
                                                                               transmission.
